                    The importance of wedding photography is emphasized by the the quick peace most 
                    weddings seem to pass by  for brides and grooms. If you ask any married 
                    couple to describe their special day, most will say it went by in a blink 
                    of an eye. This is the main reason why wedding photography is so immensely important:
                    it captures in sharp focus the moments of a day that requires months of planning 
                    and then so often passes by as a blur for the bride and groom. Beware of those 
                    photographers that note down the date of your wedding and end up showing just a 
                    few minutes before the ceremony starts. Your photographer will be sharing 
                    with you one of the most intimate days in your life. He will be there as you are 
                    getting ready, when you see each other for the first time that day, when you walk 
                    down the aisle towards your future husband and when, as a couple, you walk back down 
                    the aisle after the ceremony. He will be there when you will be introduced as a 
                    married couple for the first time, when you will have your first dance and during all 
                    other noteworthy moments throughout day. The key to a successful wedding photography 
                    is the relationship that the photographer builds with his clients. Make 
                    sure he is able and willing to sincerely be friends with you and fully gain your 
                    trust. We, at PhotoAnges, spend a long time before the wedding day becoming 
                    acquainted with you. We strongly believe in what we do, giving great emphasis to 
                    building a trustful relationship from the very beginning. We ask to meet the bride 
                    and the groom before the wedding. We chat with them to ease their natural suspicion 
                    towards the camera, we do a preliminary photographic session, where we can take
                    advantage of the more relaxed ambiance to give suggestions and directions on what 
                    to do on the the wedding day. Those are the same suggestions and directions we 
                    learned the hard way during years of experience, and can range from the best way to 
                    pose in front of the camera to how to put on the rings, including useful tips on 
                    where to buy the dress, get the best flowers or find the most exclusive and secluded
                    places to arrange the reception and the romantic photos. This is the best and only 
                    way to make you feel at ease and natural in front of the camera during your most important day.
                    We live in an era of fierce price battles. Beware of the
                    lowest prices though, of the huge discounts. The real professionals respect the 
                    importance of their work. Look for a fair price, not for the lowest. Remember that
                    photographic gear and materials are expensive. Those that give their services
                    for low prices are those who will use poor quality gear and materials. This is not what 
                    you want for your wedding... It is also possible that the paramount importance 
                    of the photography is not initially perceived by the couple. But we know how 
                    important it is that our work should preserve these precious memories. We, at 
                    PhotoAnges, truly love our work and are passionate for art and photography, doing 
                    and attending courses and stages to keep ourselves updated about the edge of 
                    technology and of the trends of the fashion. We have a profound respect for the trust
                    of our clients and strive to give them always the best, in terms of materials, 
                    craftsmanship and, ultimately, ourselves. <br><br>
