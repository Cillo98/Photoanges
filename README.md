# Photoanges
This is the newest version of the website Photoanges made for PMP Massimo Cilloni. It is an update over the previous project, a non-mobile-friendly and little adaptive website written according to the old HTML4 standards.



## Project highlights
The website was rebuilt from scratch. No templates or builders have been used. The HTML5 code contains the structure of the website only. All the styles are defined in the CSS files. Every page imports a minimum of 1 CSS file to a maximum of 3. JavaScript is used to load content into the pages dynamically, specifically to load the images in the galleries and display higher definition images on click.



## Updates

### Design
The design of the whole website has been heavily changed. The menu is now of a solid pink, opposite to the semi-transparent colour-changing menu in the old website. The menu is also more minimalistic and static. The scrolling direction of the galleries has been changed from left-to-right to top-to-bottom. The galleries now occupy the whole screen’s width and adapt to the screen size: they can be made of 1, 2 or 4 columns.
The whole website is mobile-friendly: the menu shrinks into a cascading list of links accessible via click on the top-right icon for small screens; galleries change their number of columns; text fonts and image positions are adjusted for small screens.

### Content
The navigation is more straightforward: there are only 5 links available, in contrast with the 30 links of the older website. However, the content of the website remains the same. The only removed content are the user reviews.



## Further updates
It is planned to include more content in the website, which is now missing a downloadable flyer with prices (which are only displayed in the ‘Prices’ page) and the list of the most common shots grouped by marriage phase.
The landscape view is not particularly appealing: it is planned to add landscape layouts.
